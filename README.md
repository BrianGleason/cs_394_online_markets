### Usage
Pip install to update your packages before running.

Run bid_analysis.py to return the results of the data analysis on the first-price auction simulation. 

### Part 1:
The script will return the value of netid5530 and netid5489, as well as their respective bids, the win chance of those bids, and the expected utility of those bids.
The script will also return the optimal bids for the values of netid5530 and netid 5489, their win chance, and their expected utility.

### Part 2:
The script will also provide some information from each auction on bids that aligned with the Bayes-Nash Equilibrium, what percentage of their value bidders would bid on average, and the retrospective average optimal percentage of value that players should have bid for comparison with the Bayes-Nashe Equilibrium.
The script will also display a scatter plot of the two auctions bids against their values, with a line of best fit.
